# HardToDecide
 This is a decision-based game. 
 Every choice has an impact on the final outcomes and the character's health and sanity. 
 There are a variety of good and bad endings. 
 Every good ending has a score based on health and sanity percentages.
 There is a main menu that includes play, settings and quit buttons. Both the screen resolution and the volume of the music can be changed. 
 Here are some screenshots.
